## If you're commiting changes/updates to features
# DON'T DO IT IN MAIN BRANCH

Instead, pick the appropriate branch from the drop-down list on the left side of the screen

The main branch is for the most recent stable build of the project
and for us to continue working off of for the next set of features.

Please ask Kyle to keep the repository tidy and to make new branches.
And come to a consensus if we're ready to move on to the next step.
